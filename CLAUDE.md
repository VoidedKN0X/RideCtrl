# RideCtrl

Offline vehicle maintenance, fuel and mod log in the VKNXWorks Ctrl series. Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Material 3, manual DI (`AppContainer`), JSON files in private storage plus DataStore for settings — the same structure as BeamCtrl.

## Hard rules

- **No `INTERNET` permission, ever** (the manifest removes it; CI fails the build if the APK has any network permission).
- **Google-free:** no Google libraries, services or SDKs, including transitive ones (CI checks `releaseRuntimeClasspath`). No WebView. Fonts are bundled.
- **Telemetry-free:** no analytics or crash reporting.
- arm64-v8a only. Every user-facing string goes in `strings.xml`.
- Settings open only from the profile picture. No settings tab, menu or gear icon, no You tab.
- Defaults must never be presented as manufacturer specs: service intervals and spec fields start blank or clearly as "your values".
- Store everything metric (km, litres, °C); convert only for display and input. Number inputs accept both `,` and `.` as the decimal separator.

## Dependency verification

Gradle checks every library and plugin download against the sha256 checksums in `gradle/verification-metadata.xml` (checksums only, no PGP). When a dependency, plugin or the Gradle version changes, start the `verification-metadata.yml` workflow (`gh api -X POST repos/VoidedKN0X/RideCtrl/actions/workflows/verification-metadata.yml/dispatches -f ref=main`), take the file from its log (gzipped and base64-encoded between the BEGIN/END markers), check the diff (only Maven Central, Google's Maven and the Gradle plugin portal) and commit it in the same push. Never turn verification off or make it lenient.

## Releasing

- A release is published only when `versionName` in `app/build.gradle.kts` is bumped. Bump `versionCode` by 1 at the same time.
- Tags are `vX.Y.Z` and releases are named "RideCtrl X.Y.Z". Never add a build number (`-build.N`, "(build N)").
- Use the same version for every change that ships together; README, licence and CI changes don't need a bump.
- Push straight to `main`; no branches or pull requests.

## Changelog

Every new version needs a detailed entry at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`, under a heading for that version (match the existing headings). CI refuses to release without one, and the entry becomes the release notes on GitHub, in Obtainium and in the CtrlF-Droid repo.

- Write for people using the app, not for developers: what's new, what changed, what was fixed.
- Cover every user-visible change in the version, one bullet each, with enough detail to understand it without opening the app.
- Group with `### New`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed` and `### Security` when there's more than a couple of items.
